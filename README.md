# Branch Lab

0. Fork and clone the repository locally 

1. Create a file `hello.txt` with `hello` 

2. Create a new branch `dev` and change to that branch. 

3. In `dev`, create `new_features.txt` and add some text to it. 

4. Push both branches to github. 

5. Now the feature is developed, we want that file to be integrated into the main branch. Merge the `dev` branch into `main`.
